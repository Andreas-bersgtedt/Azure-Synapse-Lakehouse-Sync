1. Add in the databricks notebooks and updated synapse pipelines
2. Pick a databricks -> ADLS authentication method
3. Update the deploySynapseSync.sh script to add the databricks cluster and notebooks
4. Copy the new dataset to the synapseanalyticspocdata storage account and update the script
5. Create some readme's to accompany the databricks notebooks, synapse pipelines, and example environment template
6. Create a PPT with data lake pattern overview, why this solution, benefits, architecture diagrams
    Focus on 3 scenarios:
        1. Synapse sync notebooks/configuration in customers production
        2. If you use the data lake gold -> synapse pattern already, 'Example Environment' is a quick easy button
           approach to see how this synapse sync works without having to build out or configure in your environment.
        3. If you DO NOT use the data lake gold -> synapse pattern already, 'Example Environment' is a quick easy
           button approach to see how it works.
7. Rename the logging.AutoIngestion Synapse tables to logging.AutoLoader
